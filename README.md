Box (working title :P)


Sometimes we encounter social issues like profanity, slander, and rumor when we discuss.
By using the non-transferable Soulbound token, we can mark accounts that are acting maliciously toward the community. and also everything that happens will be transparent.
Anyone can share their opinions freely and anonymously, while at the same time sanctioning speech that hurts others. It's very democratic.
